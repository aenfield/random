Pandas supports 'much more complex grouped operations by utilizing any function that accepts a pandas object or NumPy array.'\n",

    "For example, rather than just specifying the names of columns to define how to group, pandas lets you define your group (the keys) in terms of DataFrame column names, arrays, or functions (i.e., in code). Once you have a set of groups, you can compute things - like count, mean, etc. using pre-defined function, or define your own functions."

    "2. Apply - A function is applied to each group, producing a new value. For example, 'count' can be applied to count the number of rows (or columns, if splitting by axis = 1), sum can be applied to sum values associated with each row in the group, etc.\n",
    "3. Combine - Finally, the results of the apply step are combined into a result object. The book says taht the 'resulting object will usually depend on what's being done to the data' - I'm not sure what this means; hopefully it'll become clear after working through the chapter."
